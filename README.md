Hello Mojtaba, I had a look at your website, it is ok but I think we can find something much better than this, 
the one you showes is very sophisticated, please check this out or something similar

https://www.bcswebsiteservices.com/

that is something that we can do in css and it looks quite nice

here is Mojtaba...
I have seen the second website ( from Montaser) I think it is very good, but maybe some small things nedd js that we can neglect it.
I am agree with Montaser's Idea. but I think we have still time. please all give your Ideas. 
and I think till Saturday night, we must decide which website we choose. 
Till now, I am agree with Montaser's suggestion.
I have seen another website, it worth to have a look at
